# Code used in Viphakone and Sudbery et al., Molecular Cell (2019) in press


This repository is the "honest" record of the code used to produce all analyses in the paper. It also includes code for many more analyses that never made it into the paper. It is here as it was used in the project, and as such I have not made any attempt to "tidy it up" or ensure that it runs on machines other than the one the work was done on. The pipeline file that contains all the analyses, as run is "pipeline_proj028.py".

Any who want to extract useful code from this repository might be best dropping us a line on the issues page and we help you find the right bit of code.

See the docstrings on the pipelines for requirements and instructions on running.
